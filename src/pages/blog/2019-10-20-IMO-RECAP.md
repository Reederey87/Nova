# IMO 2020 ReCap. Be prepared for new prices.

From 1st January 2020, a new regulation will come into force to reduce air pollution from ships globally. Whereas today ships can use fuel with up to 3.5% sulphur content (outside Emission Control Areas), the new global sulphur cap will be 0.5%.  The cost of compliance with the new regulation will be significant, so the cost of shipping will increase.

Please find here below and attached some important information regarding the Low Sulphur IMO 2020 Regulation which will be applied as from 1st January 2020 on the whole shipping industry.

The new BAF surcharge aims at recovering container shipment costs of compliance with the global sulphur cap which enters into force on 1 January 2020.

For Long term deals, BAF Q1 2020 will be based on average price of VLSFO (Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil ) 0.50% of September/October/November 2019. This floating BAF will be revised on quarterly basis.

For Short-term contracts (up to 3 months validity) - not subject to floating BAF – LSS (Low Sulphur Surcharge ) will be applicable as of December 1st, 2019.

#### December 2019 LSS will be calculated as follows:
December LSS IMO 2020 = (October VLSFO price per ton – October 2019 HSFO (High Sulphur Fuel Oil ) price per ton) × TRADE COEFFICIENT   (0.6 in case of Asia to MED)

### Update on Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF)
As previously communicated, our revised Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) is designed to adjust contract rates within the duration of a contract, based on fluctuations in fuel-related costs. It applies to contracts with validity longer than 3 months. In 2019, we have used the fuel price for high-sulphur fuel (3.5% sulphur) to calculate the BAF. From 1st January 2020, the BAF tariff will be calculated based on the fuel price for 0.1% sulphur gasoil with a fixed deduction of 50 USD/ton.

### New Environmental Fuel Fee (EFF) 
Effective from 1st December 2019, Maersk will introduce a Environmental Fuel Fee (EFF) on all trades, which will apply to all spot business and contracts  with validity up to 3 months.  The EFF tariff will be trade-specific and reflect the fuel-related cost increases that result from compliance to the IMO 2020 regulation (calculated as the price difference between high sulphur fuel and low sulphur fuel multiplied by a trade factor).  The EFF tariffs will only be reviewed in case of significant fuel price fluctuations (more than 50 USD/ton).   The EFF tariffs applicable from 1st December 2019 will be announced end-October 2019.
