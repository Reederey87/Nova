        As a leading intermodal transportation provider, we offer competitive rail freight rates and seamless railway freight services across the Ukraine. 
        Shipping freight by rail is often a less expensive alternative to over-the-road (OTR) transportation which can help companies to significantly cut their overall transportation costs.
        Along with cutting freight costs, rail shipping is a long-term supply chain solution that can provide door-to-door service and economic value for businesses looking to keep pace with increasing consumer demand.
        Some of the other benefits of intermodal rail freight include increased security and a reduced risk of a weather delay and cargo loss.
        Also, since less carbon-based fuel is used when rail shipping, it is also better for the environment.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
