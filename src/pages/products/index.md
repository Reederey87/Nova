      Nova will determine the required equipment needed for transporting any over-dimensional freight.
      We obtain the required permits and can help create a specific trucking route
      taking into consideration bridges, narrow passes, or any other obstacles that may hinder transport.

        As a leading intermodal transportation provider, 
        we offer competitive rail freight rates and 
        seamless railway freight services across the Ukraine.
        Shipping freight by rail is often a less expensive alternative 
        to over-the-road (OTR) transportation which can help companies 
        to significantly cut their overall transportation costs.
        Along with cutting freight costs, 
        rail shipping is a long-term supply chain solution 
        that can provide door-to-door service and economic value for businesses 
        looking to keep pace with increasing consumer demand.
        Some of the other benefits of intermodal rail freight 
        include increased security and a reduced risk of a weather delay and cargo loss.
        Also, since less carbon-based fuel is used when rail shipping, 
        it is also better for the environment!

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
