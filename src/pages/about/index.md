## Let's Make YOUR LOGISTIC Works Better
### It's simple but very hard to achieve.
## What means NOVA?
Nova is an young, but experienced dynamic group of logisticians who are constantly looking for the right solutions for our customers. ​Whether it would be Oceanfreight import or any OOG export, customs or temporary storage, we are always looking for a winning solution to give our customers. If our customers are better off with our proposal, only then we can be satisfied. Their win is our win.
We look for innovative solutions, efficient communication and transparency across the board. Please reach out to our solutions team and let us know your challenges or questions. We are happy to go through the various scenarios and find with you which solution is the best for your company.
## Why We Are Different?
For over 15 years NOVA Logistics has provided logistics, warehousing, OOG and BBK shipping line services at their container freight station in Odesa, Ukraine.
Unlike many other logistics companies, NOVA understands that not every shipment fits neatly into a standard category.
That’s why we offer a wide range of supply chain solutions and third-party logistics services (3PL) for both standard and non-standard freight.
We strive to provide a unique customer service experience along with freight forwarding and customs brokerage services that exceed our customer’s expectations.
Our company has built a reputation based on responsiveness, flexibility, and cost-effective freight shipping and supply chain management solutions. Our success is earned directly from customer referrals and from the growth of our clients.
